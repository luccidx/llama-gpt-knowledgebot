**Porsche 914-6 GT**
The Porsche 914/6 GT was a race car built by Porsche, based on the 914 model with a 6-cylinder engine and GT package.[1][2]

**History[edit]**
The 914/6 GT was a race configured version of the 914/6. The factory offered the GT option, which was distinguishable by its box-like steel fender flares. It quickly became known as the 914/6 GT and was raced employing different engine configurations. This included the 'T' specification, which was a basic 911 engine. Another popular configuration was to use a converted Carrera 6 engine.

In 1970, Porsche entered a 914/6 with the factory's GT option in the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The car, identified as #40, was driven by Claude Ballot-Léna and Guy Chasseuil. It finished finished first in its class (2.0L GT), first of all the non prototype cars and sixth over all preceded only by prototype racecars like the V12 Ferrari 512S and Flat-12 Porsche 917K. In addition, the #40 Sonauto a non factory entry, won not only its class but also the class above beating of all the Porsche 911S including all the factory 911 entries. 914/6s also competed in some of the most important race competitions of its era, e.g. Targa Florio with Brian Redman, Monte Carlo Rally and Daytona International Speedway. Walt Maas successfully campaigned a 914/6 "GT" in the IMSA race series.

The Porsche 914/6 was introduced in September 1969 and was a collaborative effort between Porsche and Volkswagen. Short lived, only 3360 examples were produced between 1970 and 1972. Sitting very low, the 914/6's suspension is a combination of a 911-type torsion bar front suspension with a rear coil spring suspension. It also features Porsche disc brakes. The headlights hide in the hood and pop-up when needed. Its targa top can be stored in the rear trunk. The 914/6 received the ram-tuned Weber carbureted 2.0-litre flat six 110 hp Porsche engine that had been previously used with the basic 1969 911T.[3] Weighing just under 2,100 pounds (950 kg), the 914/6 proved to be considerably faster. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard equipment on all models.

In 2020, a 914/6 GT was sold for $995,000 at the Gooding & Company auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, the most valuable 914 ever sold.[4]
