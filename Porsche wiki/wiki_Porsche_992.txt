**Porsche 992**
The Porsche 992 is the internal designation for the eighth and current generation of the Porsche 911 sports car, which was introduced at the Porsche Experience Center, Los Angeles on 27 November 2018.[4]

**Design[edit]**
The 992 uses rack and pinion steering and has a MacPherson strut front suspension and rear multi-link suspension. The 992 has wide rear-wheel arches which will be a part of every model in the 992 lineage (a design feature limited chiefly to high performance variants of previous 911 iterations) along with 20-inch wheels on the front and 21-inch wheels at the rear. 

Compared to its predecessor, the 992 is 45 mm (1.8 in) wider and now uses aluminium body panels. The 992 also has a new rear bumper with larger exhaust tips than its predecessor. The front of the car is designed to mimic the appearance of an early 911 in a modern fashion.[5] 992 models have electrical pop-out door handles, a retractable rear spoiler (for specific models only) and LED headlights.[6] All models also feature a full-length rear light bar.[7] The interior also has received significant changes including a straighter dashboard which harks back to the shape of the dash board used on the classic 911. The instrument cluster consists of two 7-inch digital displays and an analogue tachometer. Also a reference to the classic 911 models.[8]

The engines have piezo injection, a revised intake system, and—in some markets under Euro-6 regulations—have engine particulate filters.[9] At launch the only available transmission was an 8-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission,[10] although now a 7-speed and 6-speed manual are available. The manual 7-speed will only be offered on the GTS and the 6-speed on the GT3 models initially, both of which will have the Sport Chrono Package as standard equipment with the manual transmission.[11]

**Equipment[edit]**
Standard equipment includes a 10.9-inch display with Porsche Communication Management (PCM) and navigation system, a 8-speed PDK transmission and driver-assistance systems including collision detection with braking intervention.[12] A Wet Mode feature is also introduced on the 992 which uses acoustic sensors on the wheel wells to detect wet pavement and adjusts the stability control, the rear wing position, and gearbox responsiveness to keep the car stable.[13] 
Optional equipment includes adaptive cruise control, night vision and sports suspension which lowers the car by 10 mm (0.4 in).[14] A Sport Chrono package is also available on all models and features an overboost function that provides increased performance for 20 seconds.[15] 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration times are decreased by 0.2 second with the Sport Chrono package.[16]

**Models[edit]**
**Carrera, Carrera 4, Carrera S and Carrera 4S[edit]**
The first models to debut in November 2018 in the 992 lineage were the Carrera S and Carrera 4S, displayed at the 2018 LA Auto Show. Both of the models are powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine.[17] The Carrera S and Carrera 4S Cabriolet followed in January 2019[18] while the base Carrera and Carrera 4 was introduced in July 2019.

**Targa 4 and Targa 4S[edit]**
The Targa body style for the 992-generation 911 premiered on the Porsche web-TV channel 9:11 Magazine on 18 May 2020. The models share the all-wheel drive drivetrain of the Carrera 4 with 8-speed PDK transmission and Carrera 4S with PDK or optional seven-speed manual, respectively. Both models are powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbo flat-six engine, which in the Targa 4 is rated at 283 kW (380 hp; 385 PS) and 450 N⋅m (332 lb⋅ft) of torque. The power output was increased by 11 kW (15 hp; 15 PS) as compared to its predecessor. In the Targa 4S, the flat-six is rated at 331 kW (444 hp; 450 PS), which is 22 kW (30 hp; 30 PS) more than its predecessor, and a maximum torque of 530 N⋅m (391 lb⋅ft), which is 30 N⋅m (22 lb⋅ft) more.

The Targa 4 is fitted with 330 mm (13.0 in) discs on both axles while the Targa 4S has larger 350 mm (13.8 in) discs on both axles. The Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) is part of the standard equipment for the new 911 Targa models. The Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), which includes an electronic rear differential lock with fully variable torque distribution, is standard for the Targa 4S and is optional on the Targa 4.[19]

In June 2020, Porsche revealed the Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition. The car uses design elements from early Carrera models with for example teardrops on each front fender and the motorsports graphics on the flanks. The car can be ordered with either the seven-speed manual transmission or PDK dual-clutch automatic and the worldwide production is limited to only 992 units.[20]

**Turbo and Turbo S[edit]**
Introduced in March 2020, the 992 Turbo S has a twin-turbocharged 3.7-litre flat-6 engine rated at 478 kW (641 hp; 650 PS) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque.[21] The engine is based on the 3.0 litre unit found in the Carrera models and has a slightly shorter stroke than that of the outgoing Turbo S engine. The compression ratio has also decreased to 8.7:1. The car can accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds (3.0 seconds for the convertible), to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 8 seconds, and has a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph). Both the turbochargers and the air intake system are larger, with the latter now being located directly behind the engine instead of in the rear fenders as on previous 911 Turbo models. The rear fenders now house the air filters instead. Two new factory options are available: Active Suspension Management and a sport exhaust. Standard equipment includes Porsche dynamic chassis control (PDCC), rear-axle steering and ceramic composite brakes. The front now has adaptive cooling flaps, while the rear wing is larger and generates 15 percent more downforce than the previous model. Active anti-rollbars, adaptive dampers and rear wheel steering are standard features.[22][23] In July 2020, the Turbo variant was introduced. It has the same twin turbocharged 3.7-litre flat-6 engine, detuned to 427 kW (573 hp; 581 PS) and 750 N⋅m (553 lb⋅ft).
In a test conducted by Sport Auto on 30th January 2021, the 992 Turbo S lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 7:17.3 minutes which made it the fastest road-legal production vehicle to lap the racetrack without using semi-slick tires.[24][25]

**GT3 and GT3 Touring[edit]**
In February 2021, Porsche introduced the 992's GT3 version. Like most other GT3 Porsches, It is intended for mixed usage with a more track-focused setup. It uses the same 4.0 litre naturally aspirated flat-6 as the 991.2, and producing over 510 PS (375 kW; 503 hp). It reaches 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds while the top speed is 320 km/h (199 mph). The 992 GT3 recently set a lap time at Nürburgring Nordschleife with a time of 6:55.34 minutes.

Unlike the standard model, the GT3 features a large rear spoiler with larger air vents, a bigger diffuser, two large exhaust connections, bucket seats in its interior, and an optional roll cage.

The GT3 uses a 7-speed PDK or a 6-speed manual instead of the 7-speed manual or 8-speed PDK used in other models.

**GT3 RS[edit]**
In August 2022, Porsche unveiled the 992 GT3 RS. A further evolution of other GT3 Porsches, it represents the highest track performance of their road-legal 911 lineup.[26] It features a dramatically improved aerodynamic profile compared to the 992 GT3, resulting in 860 kilograms-force (8.4 kN) of downforce at 285 km/h, a two-fold increase over the 991.2 GT3 RS, and 409 kilograms-force (4.01 kN) of downforce at 200 km/h. The rear wing features a static portion and an active portion, which can open and close automatically based on vehicle data, or manually with a button fitted to the steering wheel, inspired by Formula 1's Drag Reduction Systems (DRS).[27]

Its engine produces 386 kilowatts (525 PS) at 8500 rpm and 465  of N⋅m torque at 6300 rpm. The car has a redline of 9000 rpm (same as the GT3 done by its naturally aspirated flat-six engine). The curb weight of the car in European specification is 1450 kg, and it's capable of achieving 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds, and 200 km/h in 10.6 seconds. The top speed stated by Porsche is 296 km/h.[28]

**Sport Classic[edit]**
In April 2022, Porsche revealed the 911 Sport Classic. The car is based on a Turbo  but can only be had with RWD (instead of AWD) and only offers a 7-speed manual transmission (which is not an option on Turbo models).

The 3,745 cc (3.7 L) twin-turbocharged flat-six engine makes 550 PS (542 hp; 405 kW) of power and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque. This is 30 PS (30 hp; 22 kW) and 150 N⋅m (111 lb⋅ft) less than in the Turbo. Porsche had to de-tune the engine as the manual transmission couldn't handle the power and torque of the engine found in the Turbo. At the time of its reveal, the Sport Classic is the most powerful 992 with a manual transmission, followed by the manual GT3.

Porsche had to slightly decrease the front spring rates because the car does not have all-wheel drive. Visually, the car shares the same wide body found on Turbo models but doesn't have intakes in the rear fenders. Instead, the Sport Classic has ducts integrated into its ducktail spoiler. The hood is made of carbon fiber and all the active aero found on the Turbo have been removed.

The worldwide production will be limited to 1,250 units. The last time Porsche had sold a Sport Classic car was with the 997 generation, which was based on a Carrera GTS and for which the worldwide production was limited to only 250 units.[29]

**911 Dakar[edit]**
In November 2022, Porsche launched the Porsche 911 Dakar at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The model makes use of the same 2,981 cc engine found in the 911 GTS and is available only in AWD with the 8-speed PDK[30] and is limited to only 2,500 units.[31]
