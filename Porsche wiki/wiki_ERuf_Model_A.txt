**eRuf Model A**


The eRuf Model A is a late-2000s all-electric concept sports car built by German automobile manufacturer Ruf Automobile. The car was powered by a UQM Technologies[3] propulsion system (a UQM PowerPhase 150). The car has a top speed of 225 km/h (140 mph)[4] and was capable of producing 150 kW (204 PS; 201 hp) of power and 479 lb⋅ft (649 N⋅m) of torque.[1] Estimated range per charge was 250–320 km (155–199 mi), depending on performance level, using iron-phosphate, lithium-ion batteries built by Axeon plc of Great Britain.[5] During coasting the engine works as a generator producing electricity to charge the batteries.[2]

If a production car were to be built, it would be able to use a clutchless one- or two-speed transmission with no reverse gear as the electric motor can spin forward or in reverse.[1] Ruf engaged Calmotors[6] in Camarillo, California, specialized in the implementation of hybrid electric and electric only powertrain design, to combine the latest generation of lithium-ion batteries with its motor.[2]

Ruf announced that it hoped to begin production of the eRuf in the fall of 2009.[1] This did not happen, and at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, Ruf announced a new model, the eRUF Greenster, with limited production planned to commence at the end of 2010.[7][needs update]
