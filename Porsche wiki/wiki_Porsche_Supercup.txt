The Porsche Supercup (officially known as Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, known as Porsche Michelin Supercup prior to 2007)[1] is an international one-make sports car racing series supporting the FIA Formula One World Championship organized by Porsche Motorsport GmbH.

Porsche Supercup drivers compete in identical Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars. On average, 24 race cars take part in each race. Most circuits visited by the series are European, although circuits in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, the United States and Mexico have been included in the calendar as well.

**Regulations[edit]**
Two sets of slick tyres may be used per car each weekend. The number of wet tyres is unlimited. The tyres are identical for all competitors and are not permitted to be pre-warmed or chemically treated.

In-race pit stops are not mandatory and no refueling is allowed during the race, but pit stops are allowed when necessary (e.g., in case of tyre puncture, body damage, changes in weather conditions, etc.).

**Racing cars[edit]**
**Chassis[edit]**
Porsche Supercup cars adhere to a rear-engined rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a carbon-fibre space frame chassis and is covered by a multiple-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear wing, and an aerodynamic splitter. Each team may purchase cars and engines from other teams.

The car has a front MacPherson strut suspension, and a rear Multi-link suspension. Brake discs must be made of steel and may not exceed 380 mm (15 in) diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, rear wing, solid polycarbonate glass window in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays are prohibited.

Porsche Supercup cars are required to have at least 1 working windshield wiper installed on the car for all tracks as a part of the road racing rules package.

**Championships[edit]**
**Driver championship[edit]**
Points are assigned to the first 15 finishers of each race and all races count towards the championship. To receive points, a driver must compete in multiple races per season. Since 2008, there have been two bonus points awarded for the driver who secures pole position in qualifying.

In the case of a tie, Porsche Supercup will determine the champion based on the most first-place finishes. If there is still a tie, Porsche Supercup will determine the champion by the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., until a champion is determined. Porsche Supercup will apply the same system to other ties in the rankings at the close of the season and at any other time during the season.
